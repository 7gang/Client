# Client
The front-end part of the 7gang Programming For Interaction (PFI) Mini Project.

### // dev info
The client repository was rebased and migrated to [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), meaning you can now navigate to the root directory (where you issue git-commands) and do `gradle run` to start the application! View the [old repository](https://github.com/7gang/PFI-Mini-Project/tree/38cfe3bb4ff9b831e0c80ad2e962693369ae35c8) for earlier commits.
